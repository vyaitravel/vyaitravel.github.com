You'll find Gumroad integration snippets in `_includes`.
There are two ways to post a Gumroad product on your site: embed or overlay.
In this post, we will look at how to use the embed method.

## Gumroad embed
You can easily embed a product from Gumroad within your site or page.

Suppose we have a Gumroad product: [https://gum.co/supply](https://gum.co/supply){: .pink .hover-light-pink}

To embed this product, we need to add a short include with the product id to our page or post.
In this example, the ID is `supply`, so we add this include with that:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include gumroad-embed.html id="supply" %}{% endraw %}
```

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include gumroad-embed.html id="supply" %}{% endraw %}
```

That will output the product directly on your page:

{% include gumroad-embed.html id="supply" %}
